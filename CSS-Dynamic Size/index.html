                It is not known when humans first settled on the Japanese archipelago. It was long believed that there was no Paleolithic occupation in Japan, but since World War II thousands of sites have been unearthed throughout the country, yielding a wide variety of Paleolithic tools. These include both core tools, made by chipping away the surface of a stone, and flake tools, made by working with a stone flake broken off from a larger piece of stone. There is little doubt that the people who used these implements moved to Japan from the Asian continent. At one stage, land connections via what are now the Korea and Tsushima straits made immigration from the Korean peninsula possible, while another connection, via what are now the Sōya and Tsugaru straits, allowed people to go in from northeastern Asia.

                The Paleolithic Period in Japan is variously dated from 30,000 to 10,000 years ago, although the argument has been made for a Lower Paleolithic culture prior to 35,000 BCE. Nothing certain is known of the culture of the period, though it seems likely that people lived by hunting and gathering, used fire, and made their homes either in pit-type dwellings or in caves. No bone or horn artifacts of the kind associated with this period in other areas of the world have yet been found in Japan. Since there was no knowledge whatsoever of pottery, the period is referred to as the Pre-Ceramic era.

            Climatic changes help to account for the existence of a Mesolithic stage in early Japanese culture, a time when much of the abundant fauna of earlier times became depleted by the expanding human population of the archipelago. The introduction of the bow and arrow is regarded as a local response to a decrease in game available for food.

            Japan first appears in Chinese chronicles under the name of Wo (in Japanese, Wa). The Han histories relate that “in the seas off Lelang lie the people of Wo, who are divided into more than 100 states, and who bring tribute at fixed intervals.” Lelang was one of the Han colonies established in the Korean peninsula. A history of the Dong (Eastern) Han (25–220 CE) records that in 57 CE the “state of Nu in Wo” sent emissaries to the Dong Han court and that the emperor gave them a gold seal. The “state of Nu,” located on what is now Hakata Bay, in Kyushu, was one of the more than 100 states that constituted Wo. This account was confirmed by a gold seal, apparently the identical seal awarded by the Chinese emperor, unearthed on the island of Shikano, at the mouth of Hakata Bay, in 1748. In the latter half of the 2nd century, there was civil war in the state of Wo; Queen Himiko had pacified the land and, relying on her religious powers, ruled over a confederation of more than 30 states that maintained communications with the Wei kingdom (220–265/266) in northern China. Wei too sent emissaries to Wo, and friendly relations between the two sides continued during the first half of the 3rd century. The Wei zhi contains a detailed account of the route from Lelang to the court of the Wo queen in “Yamatai.”
